<center><img src="nt.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Having curved horns, a gluey coat and coarse fur, Nilgiri Tahr is an interesting animal found in the western parts of India. Tropical rainforest regions, like Annamalai Hills, Palani Hills and Nilgiri Hills, are the home to this exotic species. Notably, Nilgiri Tahr enjoys the status of state animal in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.Nilgiri tahrs are stocky goats with short, coarse fur and a bristly mane. Males are larger than the females, and have a darker colour when mature. Both sexes have curved horns, which are larger in the males, reaching up to 40 cm for males and 30 cm for females. Adult males weigh 80-100 kg and stand about 100cm tall at the shoulder. Adult males develop a light grey area or “saddle” on their backs and are hence called “saddlebacks”.The Nilgiri tahr inhabits the open montane grassland habitats at elevations from 1200 to 2600 m (generally above 2000 m) of the South Western Ghats. Their range extends over 400 km from north to south, and Eravikulam National Park is home to the largest population. The other significant concentration is in the Nilgiri Hills, with smaller populations in the Anamalai Hills, Periyar National Park, Palni Hills and other pockets in the Western Ghats south of Eravikulam, almost to India’s southern tip.</p>

<center><img src="go.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Greater One-horned Rhinoceros is a large animal that can be found particularly in Kaziranga National Park (Assam), Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (Uttar Pradesh) and Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary (Assam). Usually clinging on to the Himalayan foothills, it is one such animal that every wildlife enthusiast would love to watch. The recovery of the greater one-horned rhino is among the greatest conservation success stories in Asia. Thanks to strict protection and management from Indian and Nepalese wildlife authorities, the greater one-horned rhino was brought back from the brink. Today populations have increased to around 3,500 rhinos in northeastern India and the Terai grasslands of Nepal.The greater one-horned rhino is identified by a single black horn about 8-25 inches long and a grey-brown hide with skin folds, which gives it an armor-plated appearance. The species is solitary, except when adult males or rhinos nearing adulthood gather at wallows or to graze. Males have loosely defined home      rages that are not well defended and often overlap. They primarily graze, with a diet consisting almost entirely of grasses as well as leaves, branches of shrubs and trees, fruit, and aquatic plants.</p>

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">ASIATIC LION</span</h3></center>
<center><img src="ali.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Asiatic Lion can be easily spotted in Gir sanctuary in the Indian state of Gujarat. Notably, it is the second largest cat species in the world that can only be seen in India. Many go for a jungle safari in this national park just to have a glimpse of this royal animal.Asiatic lions are slightly smaller than African lions. Adult males weigh 160 to 190 kg, while females weigh 110 to 120 kg. The height at the shoulders is about 3.5 ft (110 cm). The maximum recorded total length of a male Asiatic lion is 2.92m (115 inches) including the tail. The most striking morphological character, which is always seen in Asiatic lions, and rarely in African lions, is a longitudinal fold of skin running along its belly. The fur ranges in colour from ruddytawny, heavily speckled with black, to sandy or buff-grey, sometimes with a silvery sheen in certain lights. Males have only moderate mane growth at the top of the head, so that their ears are always visible.Asiatic lions were once distributed upto the state of West Bengal in east and Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, in central India. At present Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is the only abode of the Asiatic lion. The last surviving population of the Asiatic lions is a compact tract of dry deciduous forest and open grassy scrublands in southwestern part of Saurashtra region of Gujarat.</p>

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">SNOW LEOPARD</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="sl.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">With long and thick fur, and brown yellowish to smoky grey skin, Snow Leopard is one of the most exotic species found in Himalayan regions of India. One can easily recognize the animal by its attractive long tail. These can be easily spotted at Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary (Arunachal Pradesh), Himalayan National Park (Himachal Pradesh), and Nanda Devi National Park (Uttarakhand). The snow leopard’s powerful build allows it to scale great steep slopes with ease. Its hind legs give the snow leopard the ability to leap six times the length of its body. A long tail provides balance and agility and also wraps around the resting snow leopard as protection from the cold.
For millennia, this magnificent cat was the king of the mountains. The mountains were rich with their prey such as blue sheep, Argali wild sheep, ibex, marmots, pikas and hares. Snow leopards are found in 12 countries—including China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, and Mongolia—but their population is dropping.</p>

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">BLACK BUCK</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="bb.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Also known as Indian antelope, Black Buck enjoys the status of state animal of Indian states of Punjab, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh. With spiral horns and charming colour, this animal is considered as an innocent and gullible species. To spot these, you can visit Corbett National Park (Uttarakhand), Velavadar Blackbuck National Park (Gujarat) and Kanha National Park (Madhya Pradesh).The blackbuck is a diurnal antelope (active mainly during the day). Three kinds of groups, typically small, are the female, male, and bachelor herds. Males often adopt lekking as a strategy to garner females for mating. While other males are not allowed into these territories, females often visit these places to forage. The male can thus attempt mating with her. As herbivores, blackbuck graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing, as well. Females become sexually mature at 8 months old, but mate no earlier than 2 years. Males mature later, at 1 1/2 years. Mating takes place throughout the year. Gestation is typically 6 months long, after which a single calf is born. The lifespan is typically 10 to 15 years.</p>

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">LION-TAILED MACAQUE</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="lt.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Found in the Western Ghats of South India, the Lion-tailed Macaque attracts people with its incomparable appearance and habits. It has got its name from the charming tail that gives it the looks of a lion. Silent Valley National Park in Kerala, Sirsi-Honnavara rainforests in Karnataka and Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in Tamil Nadu act as the home to this animal. The lion-tailed macaque is a rainforest dweller; it is diurnal, meaning it is active exclusively in daylight hours. It is a good climber and spends a majority of its life in the upper canopy of tropical moist evergreen forests. Unlike other macaques, it typically avoids humans when possible. In group behavior, the lion-tailed macaque is much like other macaques, living in hierarchical groups of usually 10 to 20 members, which usually consist of few males and many females. It is a territorial animal, defending its area first with loud cries towards the invading troops. If this proves to be fruitless, it brawls aggressively; these aggressive interactions can range from a simple chase or igniting a fight when feeling aggravated. On the other hand, when around mutualistic species, they do not engage vigorously.Lion-tailed macaque behaviour is characterized by typical patterns such as arboreal living, selectively feeding on a large variety of fruit trees, large interindividual spaces while foraging, and time budgets with high proportion of time devoted to exploration and feeding. It primarily eats indigenous fruits, leaves, buds, insects and small vertebrates in virgin forest, but can adapt to rapid environmental change in areas of massive selective logging through behavioural modifications and broadening of food choices to include fruits, seeds, shoots, pith, flowers, cones.</p>

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">KASHMIR RED STAG(HANGUL)</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="kr.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">With a light rump patch and brown coat colour, this species of deer can be seen in the state of Jammu and Kashmir particularly in the areas of Overa-Aru, Sind Valley and the forests of Bhaderwah and Kishtwar. Rajparian Wildlife Sanctuary or Dachigam National Park in Anantnag district of Kashmir is also a habitat to Kashmir Red Stag.This deer has a light rump patch without including the tail. Its coat color is brown with a speckling to the hairs. The inner sides of the buttocks are greyish white, followed by a line on the inner sides of the thighs and black on the upper side of the tail. Each antler consists of five tines. The beam is strongly curved inward, while the brow and bez tines are usually close together and above the burr.</p>

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">INDIAN BISON(GAUR)</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="ib.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">If you want a glimpse of rare Indian Bison, Kerala’s Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary and Chennai’s Arignar Anna Zoological Park are just the right places to visit. Having a giant head and a huge deep body, this big animal showcases strength and energy.The tallest of wild cattle species, the gaur is a strong and massively built species with a high convex ridge on the forehead between the horns, which protrudes anteriorly, causing a deep hollow in the profile of the upper part of the head. There is a prominent ridge on the back. The ears are very large; the tail only just reaches the hocks, and in old bulls the hair becomes very thin on the back. The adult male is dark brown, approaching black in very old individuals. The upper part of the head, from above the eyes to the nape of the neck, is ashy grey, or occasionally dirty white. The muzzle is pale coloured, and the lower part of the legs are pure white or tan. The cows and young bulls are paler, and in some instances have a rufous tinge, which is most marked in groups inhabiting dry and open areas. The tail is shorter than in the typical oxen, reaching only to the hocks. They have a distinct ridge running from the shoulders to the middle of the back; the shoulders may be as much as 12 cm (4.7 in) higher than the rump. This ridge is caused by the great length of the spinous processes of the vertebrae of the fore-part of the trunk as compared with those of the loins. The hair is short, fine and glossy; the hooves are narrow and pointed.</p>

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">ASIAN ELEPHANT</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="ae.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Considered amongst the biggest land animals in the world, Asian Elephants can be easily seen on jungle roads in South India. If you want to observe the herds of Asian Elephants, visit Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala, Kabiri Forest in Mysore and Chandaka Elephant Sanctuary in Orissa. Notably, India is home to more than 50 percent of Asian Elephants.The Asian elephant is the largest land mammal on the Asian continent. They inhabit dry to wet forest and grassland habitats in 13 range countries spanning South and Southeast Asia. While they have preferred forage plants, Asian elephants have adapted to surviving on resources that vary based on the area.
Asian elephants are extremely sociable, forming groups of six to seven related females that are led by the oldest female, the matriarch. Like African elephants, these groups occasionally join others to form larger herds, although these associations are relatively short-lived. In Asia, elephant herd sizes are significantly smaller than those of savannah elephants in Africa.
More than two-thirds of an elephant's day may be spent feeding on grasses, but it also eats large amounts of tree bark, roots, leaves, and small stems. Cultivated crops such as bananas, rice, and sugarcane are favorite foods. Elephants are always close to a source of fresh water because they need to drink at least once a day.</p>

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">BENGAL TIGER</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="bt.png" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Considered as the national animal of two major countries – India and Bangladesh, the Bengal tiger is justifiably referred to as the ‘Big Cat.’ Around 70% of the world’s wild tigers live in India. Tigers are fast vanishing due to human interference and poaching cases. The natural habitat of tigers in India – tropical evergreen forests, deciduous forests, mangrove swamps, thorn forests and grass jungles – has almost disappeared outside the reserves. Altogether, there are 48 tiger reserves in India. But one place that has captured the fancy of major wildlife aficionados is the Jim Corbett National Park. There are currently 2,226 tigers left in India.The Bengal tiger's coat is yellow to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black; the belly and the interior parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings. The white tiger is a recessive mutant of the tiger, which is reported in the wild from time to time in Assam, Bengal, Bihar, and especially from the former State of Rewa. However, it is not to be mistaken as an occurrence of albinism. In fact, there is only one fully authenticated case of a true albino tiger, and none of black tigers, with the possible exception of one dead specimen examined in Chittagong in 1846.</p>
