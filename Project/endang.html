<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">BALD EAGLE</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="bg.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px"> In the 1960s, a mere 500 bald eagles could be found soaring across America's lower 48 states. Dangerous pesticides and chemicals, released into bald eagle habitats, thinned the shells of their eggs, killing their young. By the late 1960s, only 400 breeding pairs of bald eagles were found in the lower 48 states. The outlook was not good for our national symbol. Thanks to the protections afforded by the Endangered Species Act, bald eagle numbers have rebounded to more than 7,000 breeding pairs of bald eagles today. Captive breeding programs, habitat protection, and a ban on DDT (a chemical compound used to kill insects) contributed to the successful recovery of this American symbol. The species has made an astounding comeback thanks to the amazing work of American citizens, businesses, scientists and the U.S. government. These diverse groups came together to help protect bald eagles under the authority of the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

<center><img src="fp1.jpg" width="600" height="400" opacity="1"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px"> A 1989 census indicated that the Florida panther population had dropped to between 30 to 50 individuals. This decline was the result of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation. Today, the species population is still below 100 individuals, but without Endangered Species Act protections the panther would likely be extinct. These protections include captive breeding, habitat protection, wildlife underpass construction and the introduction of Texas cougars to prevent inbreeding.

<center><img src="gw.jpg" width="600" height="400" opacity="1"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Gray wolves once ranged across the entire North American continent. However, as a result of poisoning and trapping by ranchers, farmers, and government agents, by the mid-20th century only a few hundred of the species remained in the entire lower 48 states. Today, thanks to Endangered Species Act protections, more than 2,500 wolves reside in Minnesota, roughly 500 wolves in Wisconsin and Michigan, and another 500 individuals in western states. The gray wolf’s success is a result of stimulated efforts such as public education about the species, habitat restoration, wolf introduction into various areas, and compensation of ranchers for livestock killed by wolves.

<center><img src="gb.jpg" width="600" height="400" opacity="1"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Within the lower 48 states, grizzly bear populations have been reduced to a mere two percent of their former range due to a combination of excessive hunting, conversion of habitat to human uses and fragmentation of habitat caused by such things as extensive networks of logging roads. Grizzly bears were brought under federal management when they were listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1975. At that time fewer than 250 bears occupied the Yellowstone area. Since then, the coordinated efforts of state and federal agencies, conservation organizations and private citizens have increased this population to more than 600 bears. In addition to the Yellowstone grizzlies, approximately 600 bears occupy habitat in the lower 48 states, including portions of Glacier National Park and adjacent areas in Montana and in northern Washington adjacent to the Canadian border.

<center><img src="pf.jpg" width="600" height="400" opacity="1"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px"> A 1964 survey found that peregrine falcons did not inhabit a single cliff in the eastern United States or Canadian maritime provinces. By 1970, a mere 10 to 20 percent of the historical falcon population remained, due to egg and nestling collection, intentional shooting and DDT use. Endangered Species Act protections for the falcon included captive breeding, preventing human disturbances to nesting and protection and enhancement of critical breeding and wintering habitat. As a result, populations are thriving. The species was delisted in 1999, and today there are more than 1,400 breeding pairs of peregrines in North America.

<center><img src="rcw.jpg" width="600" height="400" opacity="1"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">In the 1960s, a study predicted that the red-cockaded woodpecker would become extinct due to logging, deforestation and fire suppression. Fewer than 15,000 of these birds survive in about one percent of its former range. Thanks to the Act, restrictions were placed on habitat destruction and since 1995, more than 500,000 acres of private lands have been enrolled in conservation programs, leading the woodpecker toward recovery.

<center><img src="rp1.jpg" width="600" height="400" opacity="1"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">The red panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat with a bear-like body and thick russet fur. The belly and limbs are black, and there are white markings on the side of the head and above its small eyes. Red pandas are very skillful and acrobatic animals that predominantly stay in trees. Almost 50% of the red panda’s habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas. They use their long, bushy tails for balance and to cover themselves in winter, presumably for warmth. Primarily an herbivore, the name panda is said to come from the Nepali word ‘ponya,’ which means bamboo or plant eating animal.

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">AMUR LEOPARD</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="al.jpg" width="600" height="400" opacity="1"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">This rare subspecies of leopard has adapted to live in the temperate forests of the Russian Far East and northeastern Chinese provinces. They are known to hide their kills to save it from other predators and eat later. They can also jump up to 20 feet horizontally and 10 feet vertically.Amur leopards are currently threatened by shrinking prey tracts and the illegal wildlife trade. Due to logging and poaching of the prey species, such as roe deer and sika deer, the Amur leopards' food source is dwindling. Their fur is also a coveted resource, fetching up to $1,000 per pelt.Fortunately, conservation efforts are working! The number of Amur Leopards was down to 30 in 2007 and has doubled in just a few years.

<center><img src="or.jfif" width="600" height="400" opacity="1"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Orangutans are the most arboreal of the great apes and spend most of their time in trees. Their hair is reddish-brown, instead of the brown or black hair typical of chimpanzees and gorillas. Males and females differ in size and appearance. Dominant adult males have distinctive cheek pads and produce long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals. Younger males do not have these characteristics and resemble adult females. Orangutans are the most solitary of the great apes, with social bonds occurring primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring, who stay together for the first two years. Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan's diet; however, the apes will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and even bird eggs. They can live over 30 years in both the wild and captivity.Orangutans are among the most intelligent primates; they use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes
have been extensively studied for their learning abilities.

<center><img src="ele.jfif" width="600" height="400" opacity="1"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">The Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus) is one of three recognized subspecies of the Asian elephant, and native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. In 2011, IUCN upgraded the conservation status of the Sumatran elephant from endangered to critically endangered in its Red List as the population had declined by at least 80% during the past three generations, estimated to be about 75 years. The subspecies is preeminently threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and poaching; over 69% of potential elephant habitat has been lost within the last 25 years. Much of the remaining forest cover is in blocks smaller than 250 km2 (97 sq mi), which are too small to contain viable elephant populations.
