<h1>2.Illex Khasiana</h1>
<p>Ilex khasiana Purk. is an evergreen tree of Aquifoliaceae family reportedly endemic to Khasi Hills, Meghalaya, India; but it is also seen in a localised area of Aizawl, Mizoram, India. There is a vast history about the genus Ilex with reference to their medicinal uses in different traditional practices such as, in the treatment of coronary heart diseases, hypertension, hyperlipemia and hepatitis. Interestingly, I. khasiana is relatively unknown and yet it is known to possess multiple medicinal characteristics. The antioxidant potential studies were conducted on leaf extract specimens from Mizoram, using petroleum ether (IKP), chloroform (IKC) and methanol (IKM). IKM had the highest total antioxidant activity with 76.42 ascorbic acid equivalent (AE) mg/g, followed by IKP with 44.27 AE mg/g, and then by IKC with 17.08 AE mg/g respectively. The reducing power assay showed a concentration-dependent activity against potassium ferricyanide. The total phenolic content was found to be 3.46 gallic acid equivalent (GAE) mg/g for IKM and 1.450 GAE mg/g for IKC respectively. The total flavonoid content was 41.9 quercetin equivalent (QE) mg/g for IKC and 30.8 QE mg/g for IKM. IKP did not show any activity in phenolic and total flavonoid assays.</p><hr>
