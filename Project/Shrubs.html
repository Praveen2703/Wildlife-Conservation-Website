The best small Indian shrubs generally have flowers and attractive leaves in spring or summer seasons. In autumn, the shrubs produce berries in red, yellow or gold. 
They exist in a wide range of colors, shapes, sizes and adaptability. The shrubs can be either evergreen or deciduous.</p>

The leaves of the plant are usually bottle-green in color, light-green when young. They have concave veins, an oval shape and a glossy feel and grow crosswise up to 4 inches in length, tapering to a petite stalk. Moist, fertile soil and lots of sunlight are ideal for this shrub to grow. A healthy plant can grow anywhere between 6 to 10 feet in height and 5 to 8 feet in width.</p>

<p>Jasminum pubescens, commonly known as Jasmine, Jui or Chameli, is a popular flowering shrub of India, known for its scented, star-shaped, white little flowers. The shrub usually grows 5 to 10 feet tall, like an umbrella, spread over knolls, archways and hedges. The flowers grow in clusters blooming amidst soft, heart-shaped, dull-green leaves. Jasmine needs well-drained, fertile soil with adequate amounts of sunlight and water during its growing period. Grow Jasmine between summer and fall. Do not overwater the plant. Rot root kills Jasmine. Also, fungal and bacterial leaf spots, viruses and insects are common problems. Pruning is needed from time to time for better growth.</p>

<center><img src = "RedBell.jpg" style = "height:150px;width:220px;"/></center><br>
<p>Being named as 'Woodfordia Fruticosa' in science, the nice and beautiful 'Red Bell Bush' is very common in the South Konkan and on the riversides and it climbs the Himalayas to 1500 m. However, it is rare in South India. This is a member of the family named 'Lythraceae'.It is very small in size and is a type of spreading shrub that bears adequate leaves. The bark of the 'Red Bell Bush' is exceptionally slim and it sheds off in flakes. The shrub has a twiggy and formless appearance when it is in flower. It remains entirely sheathed in red colour at this time. The main reason behind this is that the small flowers of the shrub grow singly or in groups all the way along the branches and side twigs. The leaves also fall down at the same time.</p>

It is described as a woody creeper and it has a grey coloured bark.
