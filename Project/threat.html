<section class=sec1>
<center><h2>THREATS TO WILDLIFE</h2></center>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>1.Habitat destruction</b></p>
<center><img src="habitat.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>Habitat destruction decreases the number of places wildlife can live in. 
Habitat fragmentation breaks up a continuous tract of habitat, often dividing large wildlife populations into several smaller ones
 Human-caused habitat loss and fragmentation are primary drivers of species declines and extinctions.
 Key examples of human-induced habitat loss include deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urbanization.
 Habitat destruction and fragmentation can increase the vulnerability of wildlife populations by reducing the space and resources available to them and by increasing the likelihood of conflict with humans. Moreover, destruction and fragmentation create smaller habitats.
 Smaller habitats support smaller populations, and smaller populations are more likely to go extinct.</p>
<p><b>2.Overexploitation</b></p>
<center><img src="oe.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>Overexploitation is the harvesting of animals and plants at a rate that's faster than the species's ability to recover. While often associated with Overfishing, overexploitation can apply to many groups including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and plants.
 The danger of overexploitation is that if too many individuals of a species are taken, then the species may not recover.
 For example, overfishing of top marine predatory fish like tuna and salmon over the past century has led to a decline in fish sizes as well as fish numbers.</p>
<p><b>3.Poaching</b></p>
<center><img src="poach.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>Poaching for illegal wildlife trading is a major threat to certain species, particularly endangered ones whose status makes them economically valuable.
 Such species include many large mammals like African elephants, tigers, and rhinoceros. [traded for their tusks, skins, and horns respectively].
 Less well-known targets of poaching include the harvest of protected plants and animals for souvenirs, food, skins, pets, and more; Because poachers tend to target threatened and endangered species, poaching causes already small populations to decline even further.</p>
<p><b>4.Culling</b></p>
<center><img src="scull.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>Culling is the deliberate and selective killing of wildlife by governments for various purposes. An example of this is shark culling, in which "shark control" programs in Queensland and New South Wales (in Australia) have killed thousands of sharks, as well as turtles, dolphins, whales, and other marine life.
 The Queensland "shark control" program alone has killed about 50,000 sharks — it has also killed more than 84,000 marine animals.
 There are also examples of population culling in the United States, such as bison in Montana and swans, geese, and deer in New York and other places.</p>
<p><b>5.Pollution</b></p>
<center><img src="poll.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>A wide range of pollutants negatively impact wildlife health. For some pollutants, simple exposure is enough to do damage (e.g. pesticides). For others, its through inhaling (e.g. air pollutants) or ingesting it (e.g. toxic metals). Pollutants affect different species in different ways so a pollutant that is bad for one might not affect another.
<ul>
<li>Air pollutants: Most air pollutants come from burning fossil fuels and industrial emissions. These have direct and indirect effects on the health of wildlife and their ecosystems. 
For example, high levels of sulfur oxides (SOx) can damage plants and stunt their growth. Sulfur oxides also contribute to acid rain, harming both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Other air pollutants like smog, ground-level ozone, and particulate matter decrease air quality.</li>
<li>Heavy metals: Heavy metals like arsenic, lead, and mercury naturally occur at low levels in the environment, but when ingested in high doses, can cause organ damage and cancer. How toxic they are depends on the exact metal, how much was ingested, and the animal that ingested it. Human activities such as mining, smelting, burning fossil fuels, and various industrial processes have contributed to the rise in heavy metal levels in the environment.</li>
<li>Toxic chemicals: There are many sources of toxic chemical pollution including industrial wastewater, oil spills, and pesticides. There's a wide range of toxic chemicals so there's also a wide range of negative health effects. For example, synthetic pesticides and certain industrial chemicals are persistent organic pollutants. These pollutants are long-lived and can cause cancer, reproductive disorders, immune system problems, and nervous system problems.</li></p>
</ul>
<p><b>6.Climate Change</b></p>
<center><img src="cc.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>Humans are responsible for present-day climate change currently changing Earth's environmental conditions. It's related to some of the aforementioned threats to wildlife like habitat destruction and pollution. Rising temperatures, melting ice sheets, changes in precipitation patterns, severe droughts, more frequent heat waves, storm intensification, and rising sea levels are some of the effects of climate change.
 Phenomena like droughts, heatwaves, intense storms, and rising sea levels, directly lead to habitat destruction.
 Meanwhile, a warming climate, fluctuating precipitation, and changing weather patterns will impact species ranges.
 Overall, the effects of climate change increase stress on ecosystems, and species unable to cope with rapidly changing conditions will go extinct.
 While modern climate change is caused by humans, past climate change events occurred naturally and have led to extinctions.</p>

<center><h2>CONSERVATION OF WILDLIFE</h2></center>
<p><b>1.Project Snow Leopard</b></p>
<center><img src="sleopard.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>The species of Snow Leopard inhabits the Himalayan landscape as well as states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and Himachal Pradesh. Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and IUCN declare the species as a ‘vulnerable’ category. Additionally, the species is listed in CITES and CMS which reveals that the highest conservation status has been accorded to them, both nationally and internationally.
The International Snow Leopard Day is celebrated on 23rd October each year. The Government of India launched the ‘First National Protocol on Snow Leopard Population Assessment’ in 2019. This involves the use of technology such as camera traps and scientific surveys. This initiative was developed under the global protocol of Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program. This program is an intergovernmental alliance of 12 snow leopard range countries, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Russia, China, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia. The Population Assessment of World’s Snow Leopard (PAWS) is a collaborative effort of these countries.</p>
<p><b>2.Project Tiger</b></p>
<center><img src="ptiger.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>The population of Indian Tigers was drastically declining towards the end of the 20th century. Resultantly, a nation-wide Tiger Census was conducted in 1972 to estimate the population of tigers.
Large scale development activities including dams, mines, railway projects and establishment of industries led to deforestation and further loss of habitat. Since the body parts of the tigers are used for traditional Chinese medicine, they were killed in high numbers. All these factors collectively led to a decline in the population of tigers.
In the case of Sansar Chand vs. State of Rajasthan (2010), the appellant was arrested in 1974 for poaching tigers and smuggling their body parts to various countries, particularly China. He was allegedly involved in 57 wildlife cases between 1974 and 2005. He was convicted in all the offences registered against him. The Supreme Court also requested the Central and the State Government to take stringent actions against such offenders. 
The acts of poaching, killing, maiming, etc. of any animal are offences under Section 428 and Section 429 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The punishment under S.428 is imprisonment for two years and under S.429, imprisonment for five years.
In 1973, Project Tiger was launched in the Palamau Tiger Reserve, Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand. This is a centrally sponsored scheme of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. It is primarily governed under the Wildlife Act, 1972 itself.The project is administered by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, which was established in December 2005. </p>
<p><b>3.Project Elephant</b></p>
<center><img src="pelephant.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>Project Elephant was launched in 1992 and is a centrally sponsored scheme. Elephants face the threat of attrition, as opposed to extinction faced by Tigers. The project aims at assisting the management and protection of elephants in the States which have free-ranging populations of wild elephants. 
The Elephants’ Preservation Act, 1879 has also been formulated for the protection of elephants across the country. India has over 27,000 elephants spread over 26 elephant reserves but only 65% of the elephant corridors are in protected areas. 
The protection of elephants is also important because it has been declared as a national heritage of the country. This was done by the Government of India in 2010 after the Standing Committee on the National Board of Wildlife gave its recommendations. This step was taken to create awareness about the dwindling population of the elephants so that people would actively participate in its conservation.</p>
<p><b>4.Project Hangul </b></p>
<center><img src="khangul.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>In the 1970s, the Jammu and Kashmir Government in association with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) designed a project for the protection and conservation of the Kashmir Red Stag and its habitat. This project came to be known as Project Hangul.
Hangul or Kashmir Red Stag is a subspecies of the Central Asian Red Deer, which is native to northern India. It is mostly found in the dense riverine forests of Kashmir Valley, some parts of Himachal Pradesh, Sindh Valley, Dachigam National Park and in the forests of Kishtwar. It is also the state animal of Jammu and Kashmir. The project was started since Hanguls were enlisted in the critically endangered species list prepared by IUCN. The species is scattered through an area of 141 square kilometres in the Dachigam National Park.
The population of these deers was once approximately 5,000 in number. Problems such as overgrazing of domestic livestock in the habitat of Hanguls and criminal activities like poaching, illicit trading lead to the decline in the population of Hangul. Then, their population dwindled to as low as 150 by the end of 1970. The aim of the project was to create enclosures for artificial breeding of the species.
After the implementation of the project, the numbers rose to 340 by 1980. But over a course of time, the project however failed due to several factors. As per the census of 2008, their population was approximately 160. </p>
<p><b>5.Crocodile Conservation Project</b></p>
<center><img src="pcroc.jpg" height=200px style="border:3px solid black;" ></center>
<p>The species of crocodilians was threatened in India due to the increasing number of indiscriminate killings. They were poached for commercial purposes, which led to a drastic decline in their population. Apart from this, there was a loss of habitat due to the increasing development projects and industrialization.
In light of this situation, Project Crocodile was introduced in 1975. The primary focus was on breeding and rearing in captivity. The initiative was taken by the Government of India in association with the Food and Agriculture Organization and United Nations Development Fund.  Due to the implementation of this project, there is an increase in the population of crocodiles, which has saved them from extinction. The protected areas include National Chambal Sanctuary and Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary.</p>
