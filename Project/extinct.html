<center><img src="ic1.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Indian Cheetah also known as Asiatic Cheetah have been known to exist in India for a very long time. Due to access hunting, Deforestation and habitat loss,the fastest land animal on earth become extinct in India. The Asiatic Cheetah is a rare and critically endangered species of Big Cats family,now found today only in Iran so also known as the Iranian Cheetah, world’s last few are occasional sightings in neighbor countries of India. Indian Cheetah was found in semi-desert areas of Rajasthan and Gujarat and other open habitats where prey is available.</p>

<center><img src="ia1.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">The Indian Aurochs once lived in the hot and dry areas of India. The huge wild cattle was larger than most modern domestic cattle with height of 6.6 ft and weight of 1,000 kilograms. The Indian bison or The gaur is the largest species of wild cattle found in India.zebu and gaur are the Indian cattle, who are quite similar to the extinct wild Indian Aurochs. Extinct type of cattle was the most challenging hunting wild animal like the wild water buffalo and wild boar.The Indian aurochs was domesticated in northern India, producing zebu or indicine cattle. The primary centre of the Indian aurochs' domestication was most probably the Indus River valley, now the Baluchistan region in Pakistan. The domestication process seems to have been prompted by the arrival of new crop species from the Near East around 9,000 YBP. Human pastoralism, enabled by domestic cattle, spread throughout the subcontinent around 5,500–4,000 YBP. Secondary domestication events - instances of additional genetic diversity acquired from interbreeding domesticated proto-indicine stock with wild aurochs cows - occurred very frequently in the Ganges basin but less so in southern India. It was in the Ganges valley, in Uttar Pradesh, that the most recent evidence of wild aurochs was found. Domestic zebu are recorded from the Indus region since 6000 BC and from south India, the middle Ganges region, and Gujarat since 2000–3500 BC. Domestic cattle seem to have been absent in southern China and southeast Asia until 2000–1000 BC, when indicine cattle first appeared there.</p>

<center><img src="siv.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Sivatherium was a very large approximately 7ft tall extinct animal found in India. The giant beasts was first discovered in India, where it was called as “Sivatherium” due to the Hindu God Lord Shiva. The Sivatheres were the tallest and fastest monsters found in India ever.Sivatherium resembled the modern okapi, but was far larger, and more heavily built, being about 2.2 m (7.2 ft) tall at the shoulder, 3 m (9.8 ft) in total height with a weight up to 400–500 kg (880–1,100 lb). A newer estimate has come up with an estimated body mass of about 1,250 kg (2,760 lb). This would make Sivatherium one of the largest known ruminants, rivalling the modern giraffe and the largest bovines. This weight estimate is thought to be an underestimate, as it does not take into account the large horns possessed by males of the species. Sivatherium had a wide, antler-like pair of ossicones on its head, and a second pair of ossicones above its eyes. Its shoulders were very powerful to support the neck muscles required to lift the heavy skull.</p>

<center><img src="sr.jfif" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">The Sumatran Rhinoceros has been declared as one of the extinct animal in India. The sumatran rhinoceros is the smallest rhinoceros with two horns and only extant species of the genus Dicerorhinus. The extinct sumatran rhinoceros,once roamed and inhabited rainforests of India and neighbor north east Asian countries. They are now critically endangered species and estimated to number fewer than 275 only and found in neighbor countries of India.The Sumatran rhinoceros, also known as the hairy rhinoceros or Asian two-horned rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), is a rare member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one of five extinct species of rhinoceros. It is the only extant species of the genus Dicerorhinus. It is the smallest rhinoceros, although it is still a large mammal; it stands 112–145 cm (3.67–4.76 ft) high at the shoulder, with a head-and-body length of 2.36–3.18 m (7.7–10.4 ft) and a tail of 35–70 cm (14–28 in). The weight is reported to range from 500 to 1,000 kg (1,100 to 2,200 lb), averaging 700–800 kg (1,540–1,760 lb), although there is a single record of a 2,000 kg (4,410 lb) specimen. Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically 15–25 cm (5.9–9.8 in), while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino's body.</p>

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">PINK HEADED DUCK</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="phd.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Pink-headed Duck was a large diving blackish-brown duck,It was one of the most beautiful bird in India. The long-necked duck once found in throughout India,But it’s beautiful appearance made it most hunted birds in India, Due to access of hunting this beautiful bird is fall in the category of extinct birds in India. There is hope that the critically endangered species could still survive in some part of India our neighbor countries.The male pink-headed duck is unmistakable when a good view is had. Both sexes are 41–43 cm and long-billed with long necks and peaked heads. The male has a pink bill, head and neck while the female has a pale pinkish head and neck with a paler bill. The black of the body extends as a narrow strip on the front of the neck. Wings have a leading white edge. In flight it would not contrast as much as the syntopic white-winged duck. Wing does not have the dark trailing edge of the red-crested pochard. Confusion with male red-crested pochards stems mainly from observations of swimming birds, as the latter species also has a conspicuous red head (although the color is actually very different from the pink-headed duck). Spot-billed ducks, on the other hand, can look similar to female pink-headed ducks when in flight and seen from a distance, and if seen from behind, they could be mistaken for males too. The upper side of the wing is distinguishing, with dark green secondaries (speculum) and prominent white tertiaries in the spot-billed duck and a pinkish-beige speculum, much lighter than its surroundings, in the pink-headed duck. If the upper part of the wings cannot be reliably seen, they are all but indistinguishable except to expert observers in good visibility conditions. Young birds had a nearly whitish head without a trace of pink and a mellow two note call wugh-ah has been attributed to the species</p>

<center><img src="b.jfif" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Bharattherium is a mammal that lived in India during the Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) and possibly the Paleocene. The genus has a single species, Bharattherium bonapartei. It is part of the gondwanathere family Sudamericidae, which is also found in Madagascar and South America during the latest Cretaceous. The first fossil of Bharattherium was discovered in 1989 and published in 1997, but the animal was not named until 2007, when two teams independently named the animal Bharattherium bonapartei and Dakshina jederi. The latter name is now a synonym. Bharattherium is known from a total of eight isolated fossil teeth, including one incisor and seven molariforms (molar-like teeth, either premolars or true molars).
Bharattherium molariforms are high, curved teeth, with a height of 6 to 8.5 millimetres (0.24 to 0.33 in). In a number of teeth tentatively identified as fourth lower molariforms (mf4), there is a large furrow on one side and a deep cavity (infundibulum) in the middle of the tooth. Another tooth, perhaps a third lower molariform, has two furrows on one side and three infundibula on the other. The tooth enamel has traits that have been interpreted as protecting against cracks in the teeth. The hypsodont (high-crowned) teeth of sudamericids like Bharattherium are reminiscent of later grazing mammals, and the discovery of grass in Indian fossil sites contemporaneous with those yielding Bharattherium suggest that sudamericids were indeed grazers.</p>

<center><img src="GIG.jpg" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">Gigantopithecus, (Gigantopithecus blacki), genus of large extinct apes represented by a single species, Gigantopithecus blacki, which lived during the Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) in southern China. Gigantopithecus is considered to be a sister genus of Pongo (the genus that contains living orangutans) in the subfamily Ponginae of the family Hominidae. A 2019 study that analyzed the DNA of a 1.9-million-year-old fossil tooth confirmed that Gigantopithecus and Pongo once shared a common ancestor and that the genera diverged from one another between 10 million and 12 million years ago.</p>

<center><h3><span style="background-color:#f6e9cfff">JAVAN RHINOCEROS</span></h3></center>
<center><img src="jr.jfif" width="600" height="400"></center>
<p style="font-size:20px">The Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), also known as the Sunda rhinoceros or lesser one-horned rhinoceros, is a very rare member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one of five extant rhinoceroses. It belongs to the same genus as the Indian rhinoceros, and has similar mosaic, armour-like skin, but at 3.1–3.2 m (10–10 ft) in length and 1.4–1.7 m (4.6–5.6 ft) in height, it is smaller (closer in size to the black rhinoceros of the genus Diceros). Its horn is usually shorter than 25 cm (9.8 in), and is smaller than those of the other rhino species. Only adult males have horns; females lack them altogether.
Once the most widespread of Asian rhinoceroses, the Javan rhinoceros ranged from the islands of Java and Sumatra, throughout Southeast Asia, and into India and China. The species is critically endangered, with only one known population in the wild, and no individuals in captivity. It is possibly the rarest large mammal on Earth, with a population of as few as 58 to 61 in Ujung Kulon National Park at the western tip of Java in Indonesia. The Javan rhinoceros population in Vietnam's Cat Tien National Park was declared to be extinct in 2011. The decline of the Javan rhinoceros is attributed to poaching, primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine, fetching as much as US$30,000 per kg on the black market. As European presence in their range increased, trophy hunting also became a serious threat. Loss of habitat, especially as the result of wars, such as the Vietnam War, in Southeast Asia, has also contributed to the species' decline and hindered recovery. The remaining range is within one nationally protected area, but the rhinos are still at risk from poachers, disease, and loss of genetic diversity leading to inbreeding depression.</p>
